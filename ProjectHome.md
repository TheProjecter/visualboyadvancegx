This is an emulator wad I created using a .dol file for Visualboy Advance GX.Priiloader or some other anti-brick protection is recommended. I am not responsible for any damage/bricking of your Wii. Contact me at hanimallover13@gmail.com so that I may improve it if needed.

What you need in order to use this:

**A Nintendo WII with Homebrew Channel with at least IOS58.**

**A Wad Manager/Installer,I recommend that you use Pimp My Wii.**

**A Usb Flash Drive or SD Card formatted to Fat32.**

**Gameboy,Gameboy Color,Gameboy Advance roms .Gb,.Gbc,.Gba**
